# Contentrain 2.0 Roadmap

Private Beta version of Contentrain was released in November 2021 and underwent an effective test period by industry professionals during its first six months. This phase not only provided valuable insights, but also demonstrated that the technology was effective and useful. Since its current version was made public, Contentrain has been employed in various projects by hundreds of users.

As a bootstrapped digital product, reaching over 1000 users in a short time with the launch was great but it also brings tough liabilities for the creators of the product. Once a macro-scale product is launched and finds resonance with the users, it's crucial to be prepared for user feedback and new feature requests.

Our journey with Contentrain was no different. As soon as we made the product accessible to everyone, we were thankfully drowned with user feedback and requests for new features. While rapidly gaining users globally and making sales is some achievement, it's crucial to respond to changing market shifts and reach a wider audience through making short, medium, and long-term goals. As a team, we’re constantly synthesizing the feedback we received from users and our own experiences since the day we established the product.

Currently, Contentrain is a product that can respond the needs of its users however it needs to be constantly evolved to become a better and more flexible digital entity. We aligned our development journeys toward a land where Contentrain and its users could meet.

In January 2023, we embarked on a dedicated work period on System Design and Interface Design, marking the start of our short-term plans.

Our primary focus was to set up an excellent System Design that could enhance the application's efficiency and provide a foundation for future developments. With the new infrastructure, we'll be able to flexibly implement our medium and long-term plans.

Our next short-term plan was involved improving the application's flow. To provide users with a better UI and UX, we're revamping all the application's designs. These changes in design and flows will elevate the user experience, particularly with project setup, model creation, schema creation, and content production.

**Exciting New Features on the Horizon**

After a series of rigorous evaluation processes, we’ve come up with a list of new features for Contentrain and wanted to share it with our audience. Some of these announcements were warmly received, with many requests to add to this list. However, as you know, we couldn't implement everything at once, so we decided to add the subsequent requests to our broad list and put them on hold for future evaluation.

Some of the new features planned for Contentrain's new version are as follows:

* Workspaces

* Forked projects for Open Source Support

* Webhooks

* Collaborators

* Advance Branch Management

* Serverless Collections

* Markdown, JSON, XML Import and Export

* New Git provider - Gitlab

* On Premise

* Built in File Manager

* Extensions Marketplace

* Deployment Services

* Content Statuses - Publish/Draft/Schedule

* AI tools integrations (ChatGPT, Midjourney…)

* Template Marketplace

Reminder: Some of the features will meet with users from the moment the new version is released, while others will be added to the product with instant updates and developments. Contentrain 2.0 designing to be continuously open to improvements in the mid and long term, will be available very soon. By the end of the year, we plan to maximize our user and customer numbers.
