## Introduction

Contentrain offers a flexible and intuitive platform for content management, and a fundamental aspect of utilizing its capabilities fully is understanding how to create a content model. This guide will walk you through the process of creating a content model in Contentrain, from initiating a project to adding fields to your model.

**Step 1: Starting a Project**

Your journey in Contentrain begins with the creation of a project. This is your workspace where your content models and associated data will reside. Log into your Contentrain account and set up a new project. This initial step is crucial as it lays the groundwork for your content modeling.

**Step 2: Adding a New Model**

Once your project is set up, locate the 'Add New Model' button. This is your gateway to creating a new content model. Clicking this button will bring up a modal (a dialog box or window) that prompts you to make a key decision about your model: will it be a JSON model or a Markdown model?

**Step 3: Choosing Your Model Type**

In the modal, you will choose between a JSON model and a Markdown model. This choice depends on how you plan to structure and use your content. JSON models are typically used for structured data, while Markdown models are better suited for textual content, like blog posts or articles.

**Step 4: Naming and Describing Your Model**

After selecting your model type, a new modal will appear. Here, you will enter the name of your model and a brief description. These details are important as they help you and others understand the purpose and structure of the model at a glance. Once you’ve filled in this information, click on the 'Create Model' button.

**Step 5: Selecting a Data Type**

With your model now created, the next step is to define its structure by selecting data types. You'll be presented with a toolbox from which you can choose the desired data type for your model. For our purpose, select 'string' as your data type.

**Step 6: Choosing Markdown as a Field**

After selecting 'string', another toolbox will appear. From here, choose 'markdown'. This selection is particularly useful for content that requires text formatting options, such as blog posts or articles.

**Step 7: Creating Your Field**

Once you’ve made your selection, a screen will appear where you can define the specifics of your field. Here, you’ll enter the field name and a description. This step is crucial as it determines how the field will be identified and used within your model. After filling out this information, click on the 'Create Field' button.

**Conclusion**

Congratulations, your content model in Contentrain is now ready! You have successfully navigated the process of creating a content model, from starting a project to adding a field to your model. With your content model set up, you can now proceed to add content and utilize the full potential of Contentrain’s content management capabilities.
