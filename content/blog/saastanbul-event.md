## In One Breath: Contentrain’s SaaStanbul 2023 Journey!

SaaStanbul provided latest developments in the SaaS field and the opportunity to meet with inspiring speakers and prospects.🎙️ As a **SaaS startup**, we had participated various sessions.

Long story short, we’ve learned many different approaches that we can leverage for Contentrain to make it heard that it’s gonna be the **best Headless CMS**. 🤓![](public/images/1705914327769_saastanbul%20image1.png) In the first speech; Bengu Sarica Dincer(SEO Team Lead of Popupsmart) explained ‘’How to increase SEO and organic search results’’ 👇🏻

After this content-satisfying experience, we were presented with an impressive speech by Emrah Şamdan, Co-founder of Ampt, about Serverless technologies. He emphasized that Serverless solutions are not an one-size-fits-all approach but rather a philosophy promoting scalability & operational efficiency.

As a **Serverless Product** team, this speech reminded us of our strategic decision to combine our Git based CMS with Serverless Platforms(e.g., GCP, AWS, Supabase, Azure, Huawei etc.) And if you want to learn more about Serverless tech, you can access Emrah Şamdan's speech [via this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6vmpz3r07I).

The presentation that excited us the most was Fatma Kiraz’s, an Indie Hacker and one of Contentrain's early adopters 😊 She talked about how Micro-SaaS should create a pre-launch strategy through Product Hunt.

She explained the importance of creating interest and expectations about your product through “Coming Soon” communications before launch, based on her own launch experiences.
